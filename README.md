# Health checking gRPC server on Kubernetes

This gRPC client server application was implemented for the purpose of showing how to do the health check of gRPC servers on Kubernetes.

Kubernetes health checks (liveness and readiness probes) detect unresponsive pods, mark them unhealthy, and cause these pods to be restarted or rescheduled.

Kubernetes does not support gRPC health checks natively which means that the developers should implement it when they deploy to Kubernetes. 

gRPC has a standard health checking protocol that can be used from any language. In this example, we have implemented this standard health checking protocol in our gRPC app, and invoked the `Check()` method to determine the server's status.

The next sections provide explanations of each part of the application.

## api

The server should export a service defined in the following proto for the health check. 
The following code which can be found [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.15.0/doc/health-checking.md) is added to the __api.proto__ file:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package grpc.health.v1;

message HealthCheckRequest {
  string service = 1;
}

message HealthCheckResponse {
  enum ServingStatus {
    UNKNOWN = 0;
    SERVING = 1;
    NOT_SERVING = 2;
  }
  ServingStatus status = 1;
}

service Health {
  rpc Check(HealthCheckRequest) returns (HealthCheckResponse);
}
```

Our server provides a `ProcessText` service which receives a message and the client name as `InputRequest` and sends a message and the server name as `OutputResponse`. We define the remote procedure call functions for this service in the __api.proto__ file:

```proto
// Defining the remote procedure call function that we want to be able to call on the data.
service ProcessText{
  rpc upper(InputRequest) returns (OutputResponse){}
}
// The serialized message that client sends.
message InputRequest{
  string text = 1;
  string clientName =2;
}
// What server responds to as a result of getting InputRequest.
message OutputResponse{
  string text = 1;
  string serverName =2;
}
```
### Makefile for api

The Makefile for the api helps you to install the necessary plugins and compile your __.proto__ file.

#### Usage:

To start, make sure that the __$PATH__ and __$GOPATH__ is set up proparly.

`make dep` runs the following command which installs the Go protocol buffers plugin:

```bash
go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/{proto,protoc-gen-go}
```

`make generate-proto` runs the following command which compiles __api.proto__:

```bash
protoc -I . api.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:.
```

`make generate-proto-in-docker` is useful if you have difficulties using the previous command to compile your __api.proto__ file. This command generates the __api.pb.go__ inside a docker image and then returns the file and removes the docker. 

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(CURDIR):$(CURDIR) -w $(CURDIR) znly/protoc -I . api.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:.
```

## server-grpc

The server is given a specific name and it listens on a specific port for client requests. It provides the `Upper` service which takes the message received from the client and converts it to upper case and adds a smiley face emoji at the end of the string. Server sends the server name as a part of the `OutputResponse`. 

```go
func (s server) Upper(c context.Context, req *api.InputRequest) (*api.OutputResponse, error) {
	x := happyUpper(req.GetText())
	log.Printf("‚û°Ô∏è Received message from client %v: %v ", req.GetClientName(), req.GetText())
	return &api.OutputResponse{ServerName: serverName, Text: x}, nil
}
```

The server has a dummy database in __db.go__ that has a readiness flag `isDatabaseReady` that is initially `false`. The dummy database waits up to a certain amount of time (e.g. 30 seconds) and then it changes the `isDatabaseReady` flag to `true`. In this application, the gRPC health check is implemented for the dummy database.

```go
func connectDB() error {
	sleepTime := 30
	log.Println("‚è≥ Connecting to the dummy database. This might take up to", sleepTime, "seconds")
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(sleepTime) * time.Second)
	log.Println("üì£ Database is ready now!")
	isDatabaseReady = true
	return nil
}
```
If the `isDatabaseReady` flag is `true`, then `Check()` returns a `HealthCheckResponse_SERVING` status and if the flag is `false`, it returns a `HealthCheckResponse_NOT_SERVING` health check response. 

In general, there are four health check response serving status: `HealthCheckResponse_UNKNOWN`, `HealthCheckResponse_SERVING`, `HealthCheckResponse_NOT_SERVING` and `HealthCheckResponse_SERVICE_UNKNOWN`.

```go
func (h *Health) Check(ctx context.Context, req *grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckRequest) (*grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse, error) {
	log.Println("üè• K8s is health checking")
	if isDatabaseReady == true {
		log.Printf("‚úÖ Server's status is %s", grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse_SERVING)
		return &grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse{
			Status: grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse_SERVING,
		}, nil
	} else if isDatabaseReady == false {
		log.Printf("üö´ Server's status is %s", grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse_NOT_SERVING)
		return &grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse{
			Status: grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse_NOT_SERVING,
		}, nil
	} else {
		log.Printf("üö´ Server's status is %s", grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse_UNKNOWN)
		return &grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse{
			Status: grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse_UNKNOWN,
		}, nil
	}
}
```

In the __startGrpcServer__ function, the following steps were taken to build and start the server:

1. Specify the port we want to use to listen for client requests using `ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", port)`. 
2. Create an instance of the gRPC server using `grpcServer := grpc.NewServer()`.
3. Register our service implementation with the gRPC server using `api.RegisterProcessTextServer(grpcServer, srv)`.
4. Register the health service using `grpc_health_v1.RegisterHealthServer(grpcServer, &Health{})`
5. Call Serve() on the server `err = grpcServer.Serve(ln)` with our port details to do a blocking wait until the process is killed or `Stop()` is called.

## server.Dockerfile

To use the gRPC standard health checking protocol, we need to include the compiled `grpc_health_probe` in the container image of the server. To do this, we have used the following commands in the __server.Dockerfile__:

```Dockerfile
RUN GRPC_HEALTH_PROBE_VERSION=v0.3.0 && \
    wget -qO/bin/grpc_health_probe https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe/releases/download/${GRPC_HEALTH_PROBE_VERSION}/grpc_health_probe-linux-amd64 
RUN chmod +x /bin/grpc_health_probe  
```

## client-grpc

The `main()` function in __main.go__ instantiates a client connection, on the TCP port the server is bound to.
You can specify an ip and port by using Command-Line Flag. For example:

```bash
./client -ip=127.0.0.1:3000
```
If Command-Line Flag is not used then the default ip and port will be used for the connection.

```go
ipPtr := flag.String("ip", "127.0.0.1:3000", "Description: ip address")
```
In __main.go__ a client has been created for the __ProcessText__ service: 

```go 
client :=api.NewProcessTextClient(conn)
```

The client is given a name which is a random number.

```go
randomClientName := strconv.Itoa(seededRand.Intn(10000))
```     

The client sends the client name and a random message to the server periodically. It then receives the server name and the constructed message from the server and sleeps for 2 seconds.

```go
for {
    // Create a random string of length 10 to send to the server.
    randomMessage := randomString(10)
    // Create a context.
    ctx := context.Background()
    // Send a request.
    reqMessage := &api.InputRequest{
        Text:       randomMessage,
        ClientName: randomClientName}
    log.Println("‚¨ÖÔ∏è Client sent a message to server :", randomMessage)
    // Receive response.
    resp, err := client.Upper(ctx, reqMessage)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("‚ùå Error doing upper : %v", err)
    }
    log.Printf("‚û°Ô∏è Received Response from server %v : %s ", resp.GetServerName(), resp.Text)
    // Sleep for 2 seconds before sending another message.
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}
```

## kubernetes

The __deploy.yaml__ defines the container and pod's spec to be deployed on Kubernetes.
We use Kubernetes exec probes and define liveness and readiness probes for the gRPC server container.

For the `readinessProbe`, we use the command `/bin/grpc_health_probe`. 

```yaml 
readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command: ["/bin/grpc_health_probe","-addr=:3000"]
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 1
```

`initialDelaySeconds` indicates the number of seconds that kubelet should wait after the start of the container to performe the first health probe.

`periodSeconds` indicates how often, in seconds, the kubelet should perform the health probe.  

For the liveness probe, similarly we can use the gRPC health probe `/bin/grpc_health_probe`, or a command such as `cat /tmp/healthy` that if executes successflully it returns 0 and the container is considered alive.


## Usage

Open a terminal window, and `$ cd` into your project directory.

Start Minikube and create a cluster:

```bash
minikube start 
```
Use the following command to work with the Docker daemon on your Mac or Linux host:

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)     
```

Build the server and client images:

```bash
make build-imgs
```

Apply the configuration in `kubernetes/deploy.yaml` to a pod and deploy to Kubernetes.

```bash
make deploy
```

Now you can use `kubectl get pods` to get a list of the pods and find the exact name of the pod which should start with __grpc-deploy__.

You can retrieve more information about each pod using `kubectl describe pod`. For example:

```bash
kubectl describe pod grpc-deploy-8f95984fd-qm2xd
```

This should show a message about the readiness probe failing `Readiness probe failed: service unhealthy (responded with "NOT_SERVING")`.

If you check the Readiness status of the server using `kubectl describe pod` before the database is ready, it should show `false`, otherwise if you check it after the database is ready, then it should show `true`.

To see the messages that are sent and received between client and server, you can use the following commands to print the logs of the client and server containers:

```bash
kubectl log grpc-deploy-8f95984fd-qm2xd  -c client
kubectl log grpc-deploy-8f95984fd-qm2xd  -c server
```
Finally, to delete the deployment, simply use:

```bash
kubectl delete deploy grpc-deploy
```
